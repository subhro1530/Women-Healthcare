              Women's healthcare is rooted in essential values that prioritize
              holistic well-being, inclusivity, and empowerment. Central to this
              care is respect for autonomy, ensuring women have agency in
              decisions about their bodies and health choices. Compassion forms
              another cornerstone, acknowledging the emotional and physical
              intricacies of women's health experiences.
            </Text>
            <Text mb={6} fontSize="lg">
              Equality stands as a fundamental value, advocating for fair and
              unbiased access to healthcare, irrespective of race, ethnicity,
              socioeconomic status, or gender identity. Education and
              empowerment empower women to make informed decisions about their
              health, fostering a sense of ownership and active participation in
              their care.
            </Text>
            <Text mb={6} fontSize="lg">
              Moreover, dignity and confidentiality are upheld, providing a safe
              and respectful environment where women feel heard, valued, and
              supported throughout their healthcare journey.
